            The method we used to bring LiveTL to Android, while possible on iOS, is never going to be allowed by Apple
            to be released on the App Store. <br/>
            Because of this we would have to write an entire app from scratch, something that no one on the development
            team currently wants to, or has time to do.

            The cost of the Apple Developer Program is also a big factor, as it would cost us $100 USD (per year!) to
            join. In the future, we may start accepting donations, but for now, we are not able to pay for it.

            Because of all this, we aren't really looking at creating a solution for iOS for now. It's not completely
            out of the question, just out of reach with our current means. If you are a mobile developer (doesn't
            necessarily have to be iOS specific, but something that supports iOS, such as <a
            href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin">Xamarin</a> or <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>)
            or you are able to help us out with the Apple Developer Program, please join us on <a
            href="https://discord.gg/uJrV3tmthg">Discord</a> and let us know! We'd be happy to have
            you join the team!
